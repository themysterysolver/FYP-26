    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start

    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not

    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
